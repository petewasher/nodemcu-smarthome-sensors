# Smarthome Sensors - Using NodeMCU & InfluxDB

## Basic
This is a basic project which shows how to connect a node MCU to wifi. 

## BME680 
This is a project which shows how to use a bme680 sensor from Pimoroni to deliver data over to InfluxDB

## DHT22
This is a project which shows how to use a DHT22 sensor to deliver data over to InfluxDB.

# Requirements
* NodeMCU or other ESP 12-F board.
* DHT22 or BME680 sensor appropriately wired

## Libraries
* Arduino Unified Sensor
* ESP866 Library
* ESP8266 board support
